# VPC Scripts

## vpc-network-diagram.py

Use the Python `pip` utility to install the Python modules listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt). Then run [vpc-network-diagram.py] with the `--help` option for usage information.

In most cases you would just run the script with the VPC ID or VPC Name as the only argument. It will generate a PNG file of the same name.
